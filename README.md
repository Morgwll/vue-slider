# vue-slider
This is a simple responsive slider using Vue.js

As the first component to be done with a different approach to modular development, this time the idea is to build the separate components first and assemble them later, as opposed to building a bigger project and scrap it for parts later. 

With this approach every component can be looked after by different developers and different teams. Every iteration better than the last, every project overall more efficient.

Some of the ideas might not be everybody's cup of tea but make sense as a whole.
